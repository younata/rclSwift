##rclSwift - Ros2 Client Library for Swift (2.2)

rclSwift is an attempt at implementing a usable Ros Client Library in Swift.

Heavily inspired by the [reference implementation of rcl](https://github.com/ros2/rcl)

Tests are provided, but until [Swift Evolution Proposal 19](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0019-package-manager-testing.md) is accepted, they're pretty much worthless.
